# Sentiment Classificaton on Twitter data
This approach combines two powerful techniques in machine learning: ensemble learning and hyperparameter optimization.

# CNN Model
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. However, they can also be adapted for sequential data like text. In sentiment analysis, CNNs can learn to extract meaningful features from text data by convolving over sequences of words.

# Ensemble Method: 
Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to improve predictive performance. In this context, multiple CNN models may be trained with different initializations or hyperparameters to capture diverse aspects of the data. The predictions from these individual models are then aggregated to produce a final prediction, often resulting in improved accuracy and robustness.

# Grid Search Hyperparameter Optimization: 

Hyperparameters are settings that are external to the model and cannot be learned from the training data. Grid search is a technique used to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. It involves defining a grid of hyperparameter values and exhaustively searching through all possible combinations to identify the combination that yields the best performance on a validation set.

Combining these techniques involves training multiple CNN models with different hyperparameter configurations and then selecting the best-performing models using grid search. These selected models are then combined using ensemble methods, such as averaging or weighted voting, to classify the sentiments of Twitter tweets effectively.
